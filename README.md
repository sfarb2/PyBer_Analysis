# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate rideshare utilization across three distinct types of areas - urban, suburban, and rural.

## Results

### Overall Data
![DataFrame](/Final_DataFrame.png)

Not surprisingly, rideshare services are used much more frequently in dense, urban populations. 

Over the same period of time, urban centers produced 13 times more rides than did rural areas (and 2.6 times more than suburban towns); however, the number of available drivers was not proportional. Rural drivers averaged 1.6 rides apiece while the mean number of rides for each urban driver was less than one (0.68)! Accordingly, though much more money was collectively spent on urban rideshares, the average cost of each ride and the average total fares accumulated by each driver grew as density decreased.

### Data by Month

#### Urban
The trajectories of rideshare usage actually look pretty similar over time. Urban markets appear to be the most volatile in the four-month period sampled as there are numerous sharp peaks and valleys, particularly from late February through March, that often account for up to 20 percent of all fares. Overall though, urban ridership increased in value substantially in this window, with total fares growing by ~$500.

#### Suburban
Total suburban fares also grew significantly between January and April 2019, nearly doubling their return over that span. Through the four-month period, suburban fares were much more stable (plummeting sharply in late February) and though most of the gains were lost by mid-April, a strong climb at the end of the month saw suburban fares recoup those gains almost in their entirety.

#### Rural
Rural fares were about the same at the end of April as they were at the beginning of January. Because there were fewer rides, the changes from week to week were generally more pronounced than in urban/suburban areas (for example, the second week in January saw total fares approach zero but by the following week they had rebounded and outperformed their initial earnings). Like in urban and suburban locales, late February saw a significant increase in rider fares; however, early April was the most lucrative window in rural areas - a similarly profitable time for urban centers but the beginning of a steep decline in suburban usage.

## Summary
Based on the chart and graph above, we have multiple recommendations for the business.

### Recommendations
1. Though revenue is high in urban areas, the fact that there are more drivers than there are rides means that clearly we can support greater demand. We should increase ads/offer promotions in these localities to take advantage of the excess willing drivers available and attempt to secure repeat business.
2. Across all types of locations, there is a spike in total fares toward the end of February. Because our initial visualizations don't make clear whether those inceases are due to more valuable individual rides or increased volume of ridership overall, we should perform further analysis here to ensure that we can maximize profits in this particularly lucrative window.
3. The relatively high value of rural rides and earnings of rural drivers could help us recruit in those areas. We could consider running a driver-targeted digital ad campaign so the demand does not outstrip the supply.
